Repository for the documentation of the OpenSource OmniProject 


# Introduction

Last update : 14.05.2024

The OmniProject is a project to design an USB-oscilloscope, that is much easier to handle than a normal oscilloscope and has a variable multichannel functionality. Additionally, its integrated analyses make it accessible to individuals outside the scientific community.

This document provides an overview of the various repositories included in the OmniProject. The first line displays the last update date, indicating the document's current temporal standpoint.

In this document you can find the repositories and documentation of the Hardware, Firmware and Software of the OmniScope and OmniView. 

The project is mostly an OpenSource project started by the Auto-Intern company. 


## Hardware

## Software
### The OmniView GUI

The OmniView GUI is the main part of the OmniProject. The Software is used to connect the OmniScope to the Laptop, take measurements and analyse this measurements. 

A representation of the OmniView software structure can be found in the OmniView-Product-Vision Document which is linked in the repository under sw/OmniView-Product-Vision. 

The documentation of the OmniView Software Code and the Softwarecode itself can be found in the OmniView repository which is linked under sw/OmniView and sw/ai_OmniViewSW_doc. 

The documentation of the used API's can be found under sw/API/file. Currently only the documentation for the FFT API exists. 

### DLL
Some parts of the code should be outsourced into a .dll. 
The demo is right now documented in the linked UaDI repository linked under fw/UaDI.
